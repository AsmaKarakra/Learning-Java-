//Methods In Java 

// Methods in Java are just a block of code that we can use to perform a specifc task. 

//aka function - methods are the same thing as functions 

public class App { 
		public static void main(String [] args) { 
		
		// this public method is a special method inside our java file 
		
		//the code insided our main function is what first gets called to execuate our java program 
		
		} 
		
		
		// we're going to create a couple of method
		
		// here we're out of the bounds of the main method 
		
		
		public static void sayHi() {
			
			// this is the basic sekeleton for a method
		
		} 
		
		
		
		// we can type out some code in the method and when we call the method, that code will be execuated 
		
		
		public static void sayHi() {
			
		System.out.println("Hello Mike") } 
		
		
		// in our main method, we can have 
		
		
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			
			sayHi(); 
			
		} 
		
		
		// this will output, "Hello Mike!" 
		
		
		
} 


// if we had the following:

System.out.println("Top"); 

sayHi();  

System.out.print("Bottom"); 

//output will be:
		//Top
		//"Hello Mike!"
		//Bottom
		
		// when you call a function, you're telling your program to execuate the function and come back.

	// We can also pass in parameters to our functions 
	
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }

// we can also rewrite our class to have two variables, like a name and age 

// the method is now taking in two parameters 

// if you have a specifc code performing a specifc task, you can put it inside a main method
