		// < String > < [] >  < name of array > = < { "value1", "value2", } > 
		
		// the [] tells java we wannt to create an array 
		
		// to print out the first item

	// to access attributes of array such as length 
	
	System.out.println(friends.length()); // this will output 3 because there are 3 elements within our array 
	
	
	// we can also modify the value by acessing it 
	
	friends[0] = "Karen"; //use this as a normal variable and we can change what is in the array 
	
	//Sometimes we dont have elements of our array up front 
	
	String [] friends = new String[] //need to tell java how many elements we want to put inside of it 
	
	String [] friends = new String[3] // we are now telling java that we want 3 elements inside the array 
	
	//now we can tell it what elements we want 
	
	// to populate the array, we can do the following: 
	
	String [] friends = new String[3]; 
	
	friends[0] = "Mike"; 
	friends[1] = "Jim"; 
	friends[2] = "Karen";
